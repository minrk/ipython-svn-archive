This is the document processing module for the interactive notebooks project.

The code is migrated from the 'cell' branch in google-rkern
repository, and has been developed since mostly to match the needs of
the nbshell module, i.e. the GUI. And of course to provide the
necessary features for notebook documents.

Major refactorings regarding this module, and how it's used in
nbshell, is needed and planned. For more info on that, the file
'notes' here is an irc session where it was discussed. It will
hopefully be made useless soon by either implementations and/or
design docs.
