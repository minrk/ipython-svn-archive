<title>Special functions (special)</title>
<para>The main feature of the special package is the definition of
numerous special functions of mathematical physics. Available functions include
airy, elliptic, bessel, gamma, beta, hypergeometric, parabolic cylinder,
mathieu, spheroidal wave, struve, and kelvin. There are also some low-level
stats functions that are not intended for general use as an easier interface to
these functions is provided by the stats module. Most of these functions can
take array arguments and return array results following the same broadcasting
rules as other math functions in Numerical Python. Many of these functions also
accept complex-numbers as input. For a complete list of the available functions
with a one-line description type &gt;&gt;&gt;info(special). Each function also has it's
own documentation accessible using help. If you don't see a function you need,
consider writing it and contributing it to the library. You can write the
function in either C, Fortran, or Python. Look in the source code of the library
for examples of each of these kind of functions.
