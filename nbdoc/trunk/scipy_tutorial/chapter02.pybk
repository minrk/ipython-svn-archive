<title>Basic functions in scipy_base and top-level scipy</title>
<section>
<title>Interaction with Numeric</title>
<para>To begin with, all of the Numeric functions have been subsumed into
the scipy namespace so that all of those functions are available without
additionally importing Numeric. In addition, the universal functions (addition,
subtraction, division) have been altered to not raise exceptions if
floating-point errors are encountered<footnote><para>These changes are all made in a new module
(fastumath) that is part of the scipy_base package. The old functionality is
still available in umath (part of Numeric) if you need it (note: importing umath
or fastumath resets the behavior of the infix operators to use the umath or
fastumath ufuncs respectively).</para></footnote>, instead NaN's and Inf's are returned in the
arrays. To assist in detection of these events new universal functions (isnan,
isfinite, isinf) have been added.
</para>
<para>In addition, the comparision operators have been changed to allow
comparisons and logical operations of complex numbers (only the real part is
compared). Also, with the new universal functions in SciPy, the logical
operations (except logical_XXX functions) all return arrays of unsigned bytes
(8-bits per element instead of the old 32-bits, or even 64-bits) per
element<footnote><para>Be
careful when treating logical expressions as integers as the 8-bit integers may
silently overflow at 256.</para></footnote>.
</para>
<para>In an effort to get a consistency for default arguments, some of the
default arguments have changed from Numeric. The idea is for you to use scipy as
a base package instead of Numeric anyway.
</para>
<para>Finally, some of the basic functions like log, sqrt, and inverse trig functions
have been modified to return complex numbers instead of NaN's where appropriate.

<title>scipy_base routines</title>
<para>ï»¿The purpose of scipy_base is to collect general-purpose routines
that the other sub-packages can use and to provide a simple replacement for
Numeric. Anytime you might think to import Numeric, you can import scipy_base
instead and remove yourself from direct dependence on Numeric. These routines
are divided into several files for organizational purposes, but they are all
available under the scipy_base namespace (and the scipy namespace). There are
routines for type handling and type checking, shape and matrix manipulation,
polynomial processing, and other useful functions. Rather than giving a detailed
description of each of these functions (which is available using the help, info
and source commands), this tutorial will discuss some of the more useful
commands which require a little introduction to use to their full potential. 
</para>
<section>
<title>Type handling</title>
<para>Note the difference between iscomplex (isreal) and iscomplexobj
(isrealobj). The former command is array based and returns byte arrays of ones
and zeros providing the result of the element-wise test. The latter command is
object based and returns a scalar describing the result of the test on the
entire object. 
</para>
<para>Often it is required to get just the real and/or imaginary part of a complex
number. While complex numbers and arrays have attributes that return those
values, if one is not sure whether or not the object will be complex-valued, it
is better to use the functional forms real and imag. These functions succeed for
anything that can be turned into a Numeric array. Consider also the function
real_if_close which transforms a complex-valued number with tiny imaginary part
into a real number. 
</para>
<para>Occasionally the need to check whether or not a number is a scalar (Python
(long)int, Python float, Python complex, or rank-0 array) occurs in coding. This
functionality is provided in the convenient function isscalar which returns a 1
or a 0. 
</para>
<para>Finally, ensuring that objects are a certain Numeric type occurs often enough
that it has been given a convenient interface in SciPy through the use of the
cast dictionary. The dictionary is keyed by the type it is desired to cast to
and the dictionary stores functions to perform the casting. Thus, &gt;&gt;&gt; a =
cast['f'](d) returns an array of float32 from d. This function is also useful as
an easy way to get a scalar of a certain type: &gt;&gt;&gt; fpi = cast['f'](pi) although
this should not be needed if you use alter_numeric().
</para>

<section>
<title>Index tricks</title>
<para>There are some class instances that make special use of the slicing
functionality to provide efficient means for array construction. This part will
discuss the operation of mgrid, ogrid, r_, and c_ for quickly constructing
arrays. 
</para>
<para>One familiar with Matlab may complain that it is difficult to construct arrays
from the interactive session with Python. Suppose, for example that one wants to
construct an array that begins with 3 followed by 5 zeros and then contains 10
numbers spanning the range -1 to 1 (inclusive on both ends). Before SciPy, you
would need to enter something like the following &gt;&gt;&gt;
concatenate(([3],[0]*5,arange(-1,1.002,2/9.0)). With the r_ command one can
enter this as &gt;&gt;&gt; r_[3,[0]*5,-1:1:10j] which can ease typing and make for more
readable code. Notice how objects are concatenated, and the slicing syntax is
(ab)used to construct ranges. The other term that deserves a little explanation
is the use of the complex number 10j as the step size in the slicing syntax.
This non-standard use allows the number to be interpreted as the number of
points to produce in the range rather than as a step size (note we would have
used the long integer notation, 10L, but this notation may go away in Python as
the integers become unified). This non-standard usage may be unsightly to some,
but it gives the user the ability to quickly construct complicated vectors in a
very readable fashion. When the number of points is specified in this way, the
end-point is inclusive.
</para>
<para>The "r" stands for row concatenation because if the objects between commas are 2
dimensional arrays, they are stacked by rows (and thus must have commensurate
columns). There is an equivalent command c_ that stacks 2d arrays by columns but
works identically to r_ for 1d arrays. 
</para>
<para>Another very useful class instance which makes use of extended slicing notation
is the function mgrid. In the simplest case, this function can be used to
construct 1d ranges as a convenient substitute for arange. It also allows the
use of complex-numbers in the step-size to indicate the number of points to
place between the (inclusive) end-points. The real purpose of this function
however is to produce N, N-d arrays which provide coordinate arrays for an
N-dimensional volume. The easiest way to understand this is with an example of
its usage: 
</para>
<para>XXX: 
&gt;&gt;&gt; mgrid[0:5,0:5]
array([[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
        [3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
        [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]],
       [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]])  
&gt;&gt;&gt; mgrid[0:5:4j,0:5:4j]
array([[[ 0.    ,  0.    ,  0.    ,  0.    ],
        [ 1.6667,  1.6667,  1.6667,  1.6667],
        [ 3.3333,  3.3333,  3.3333,  3.3333],
        [ 5.    ,  5.    ,  5.    ,  5.    ]],
       [[ 0.    ,  1.6667,  3.3333,  5.    ],
        [ 0.    ,  1.6667,  3.3333,  5.    ],
        [ 0.    ,  1.6667,  3.3333,  5.    ],
        [ 0.    ,  1.6667,  3.3333,  5.    ]]])
</para>
<para>Having meshed arrays like this is sometimes very useful. However, it is
not always needed just to evaluate some N-dimensional function over a grid due
to the array-broadcasting rules of Numeric and SciPy. If this is the only
purpose for generating a meshgrid, you should instead use the function ogrid
which generates an "open" grid using NewAxis judiciously to create N, N-d arrays
where only one-dimension in each array has length greater than 1. This will save
memory and create the same result if the only purpose for the meshgrid is to
generate sample points for evaluation of an N-d function. 
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Shape manipulation</title>
<para>In this category of functions are routines for squeezing out length-one
dimensions from N-dimensional arrays, ensuring that an array is at least 1-, 2-,
or 3-dimensional, and stacking (concatenating) arrays by rows, columns, and
"pages" (in the third dimension). Routines for splitting arrays (roughly the
opposite of stacking arrays) are also available. 
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Matrix manipulations</title>
<para>These are functions specifically suited for 2-dimensional arrays that were
part of MLab in the Numeric distribution, but have been placed in scipy_base for
completeness so that users are not importing Numeric. 
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Polynomials</title>
<para>There are two (interchangeable) ways to deal with 1-d polynomials in
SciPy. The first is to use the poly1d class in scipy_base. This class accepts
coefficients or polynomial roots to initialize a polynomial. The polynomial
object can then be manipulated in algebraic expressions, integrated,
differentiated, and evaluated. It even prints like a polynomial:
</para>
<para> XXX: ipython
&gt;&gt;&gt; p =
poly1d([3,4,5])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p
   2
3 x + 4 x + 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p*p
   4      3      2
9 x + 24 x + 46 x + 40 x + 25
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.integ(k=6)
 3     2
x + 2 x + 5 x + 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.deriv()
6 x + 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; p([4,5])
array([ 69, 100])
</para>
<para>The other way to handle polynomials is as an array of coefficients with
the first element of the array giving the coefficient of the highest power.
There are explicit functions to add, subtract, multiply, divide, integrate,
differentiate, and evaluate polynomials represented as sequences of
coefficients. 
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Vectorizing functions (vectorize)</title>
<para>One of the features that SciPy provides is a class vectorize to convert an
ordinary Python function which accepts scalars and returns scalars into a
"vectorized-function" with the same broadcasting rules as other Numeric
functions (i.e. the Universal functions, or ufuncs). For example, suppose you
have a Python function named addsubtract defined as:
</para>
<para>XXX: ipython
&gt;&gt;&gt; def addsubtract(a,b):
    if a &gt; b:
        return a - b
    else:
        return a + b
</para>
<para>which defines a function of two scalar variables and returns a scalar
result. The class vectorize can be used to "vectorize" this function so that
returns a function which takes array arguments and returns an array result:
</para>
<para> XXX: ipython
&gt;&gt;&gt; vec_addsubtract([0,3,6,9],[1,3,5,7])
array([1, 6, 1, 2])
</para>
<para>This particular function could have been written in vector form without
the use of vectorize. But, what if the function you have written is the result
of some optimization or integration routine. Such functions can likely only be
vectorized using vectorize.
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Other useful functions</title>
<para>There are several other functions in the scipy_base package including most
of the other functions that are also in MLab that comes with the Numeric
package. The reason for duplicating these functions is to allow SciPy to
potentially alter their original interface and make it easier for users to know
how to get access to functions &gt;&gt;&gt; from scipy import *.
</para>
<para>New functions which should be mentioned are mod(x,y) which can replace x%y
when it is desired that the result take the sign of y instead of x. Also
included is fix which always rounds to the nearest integer towards zero. For
doing phase processing, the functions angle, and unwrap are also useful. Also,
the linspace and logspace functions return equally spaced samples in a linear or
log scale. Finally, mention should be made of the new function select which
extends the functionality of where to include multiple conditions and multiple
choices. The calling convention is select(condlist,choicelist,default=0). Select
is a vectorized form of the multiple if-statement. It allows rapid construction
of a function which returns an array of results based on a list of conditions.
Each element of the return array is taken from the array in a choicelist
corresponding to the first condition in condlist that is true. For example 
</para>
<para> XXX: ipython
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = r_[-2:3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array([-2, -1,  0,  1,  2])
&gt;&gt;&gt; select([x &gt; 3, x &gt;= 0],[0,x+2])
array([0, 0, 2, 3, 4])
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<title>Common functions</title>
<para>Some functions depend on sub-packages of SciPy but should be
available from the top-level of SciPy due to their common use. These are
functions that might have been placed in scipy_base except for their dependence
on other sub-packages of SciPy. For example the factorial and comb functions
compute 
<inlineequation>
<alt role="latex">n!</alt>
</inlineequation>
 and 
<inlineequation>
<alt role="latex">n!/k!(n-k)!</alt>
</inlineequation> 
using either exact integer arithmetic (thanks to
Python's Long integer object), or by using floating-point precision and the
gamma function. The functions rand and randn are used so often that they
warranted a place at the top level. There are convenience functions for the
interactive use: disp (similar to print), and who (returns a list of defined
variables and memory consumption--upper bounded). Another function returns a
common image used in image processing: lena. 
</para>
<para>Finally, two functions are provided that are useful for approximating
derivatives of functions using discrete-differences. The function
central_diff_weights returns weighting coefficients for an equally-spaced
N-point approximation to the derivative of order o. These weights must be
multiplied by the function corresponding to these points and the results added
to obtain the derivative approximation. This function is intended for use when
only samples of the function are avaiable. When the function is an object that
can be handed to a routine and evaluated, the function derivative can be used to
automatically evaluate the object at the correct points to obtain an N-point
approximation to the 
<inlineequation>
<alt role="latex">o^{\textrm{th}}</alt>
</inlineequation>-derivative at a given point. 
</para>
