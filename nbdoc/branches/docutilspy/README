This is a first take at implementing the notebooks as Python,
as was originally envisioned in the Google/SoC proposal.

The idea for the API was presented in
http://www.scipy.net/pipermail/ipython-dev/2005-June/000481.html and
this experiment also for the docutils folks in
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.text.docutils.devel/3032 , resulting
in a patch even (has not been applied (yet)).

As the development has progressed with the xml backed solution, this
code is obsolete and added to here mostly for historical reasons.  But
this kind of a frontend could be well implemented to the main backend
too .. say if someone likes to write notebooks as Python instead of
using an editor or XML. This is still similar to mr. de Ridder's work,
from where the idea for using singleton classes to describe content
entities came, as he's been also using Python as a better way to write XML.

putting branch this aside to continue with the trunk,
