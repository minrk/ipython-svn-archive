This is the document processing module for the interactive notebooks project.

The code is migrated from the 'cell' branch in google-rkern
repository, and has been developed since mostly to match the needs of
the nbshell module, i.e. the GUI. And of course to provide the
necessary features for notebook documents.

The XSLT packaged needed to process notebooks to e.g. html and latex
(and via that to pdf, provided that pdflatex is also installed in the
system) are available at
