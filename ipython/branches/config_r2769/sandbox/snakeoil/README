 SnakeOil - Python testing that doesn't squeak
===============================================

This module provides a few small utilities for easier/smoother testing
workflows in Python, using only the facilities of the standard library (doctest
and unittest).  While it can be installed as a package via setup.py, it is
meant to be small enough that projects wanting to use it can just copy a few
files into their testing directory and use carry it internally, thus avoiding
the need to create an external dependency on SnakeOil.

Its main purposes are (see the docs for more details):

- Easy creation of parametric tests (unittests that take arguments).

- Immediate use of any standalone testing script as a unit test, without having
to subclass anything.

- Easy mechanisms for creating valid doctest (.txt) files from true Python
sources, so that one can edit real Python code in an editor and convert that
code to a set of doctests with minimal effort.


See the doc/ directory for detailed documentation and a reasonably complete set
of examples.


Requirements
============

The test *running* facilities, the parametric test classes, the
scripts-as-tests support, etc, work on all platforms and depend only on the
standard library and IPython.

However, the doctest-generation part of this package uses the IPyhton.irunner
module, which requires pexpect.  Unfortunately pexpect only runs under *nix, so
this functionality will not currently run under Windows (until someone figures
out how to port pexpect to Windows).

Under Windows, you will have to generate your doctests via some mechanism other
than py2doctest or mkdoctest supplied here.


Installation
============

This is a standard Python package, so the usual::

  python setup.py install

call should work as usual.
