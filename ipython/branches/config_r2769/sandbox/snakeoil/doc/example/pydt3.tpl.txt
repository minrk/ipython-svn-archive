 py2doctest example - file inclusions
======================================

Basic usage
===========

This simple example shows how to write standalone text/reST files that contain
the bulk of your documentation, while further including pure code files via
special %run directives.

For example, the contents of file pydt3_inc1.py will be executed and included
below directly.

%run pydt3_inc1.py

You can include more than one file in this manner:

%run pydt3_inc2.py


As well as keep regular doctests done 'the old fashioned way'::

    >>> print "Hello world"
    Hello world


Personal opinion
================

I think the mode of auto-generating a full doctest file from Python code is
more conveniently used by writing the text inside '###' comments and using
SnakeOil's conversion to reST, since that allows you to have editor support for
the actual Python programming, where it is more critical than when editing the
text.

But some people prefer to edit reST, so this option is also offered.  It would
be particularly useful if there was an editor (or emacs mode) that supported
full Python when indented and reST otherwise.
