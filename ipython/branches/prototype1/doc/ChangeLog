        * ipython1/test: Setup a test directory as a sub-module of
        ipython1.  This makes it possible to test ipython1 using Twisted's
        trial command:

        trial ipython1

        This command will find and run the unittests in the test module 
        in files named tests_*.py.  Most importantly, it will manage the 
        Twisted reactor and deferreds.  I have written initial tests for 
        ipython1.core.shell.py.

        * ipython1/kernel: I have begun to write the code for the two process 
        kernel.  I need to write unittests for this stuff.

        * core/shell.py: Began to rework the TrappingInteractiveConsole class
        into something that will become the IPython core.

        * kernel_client.py: Added a block property to the InteractiveCluster
        class.  When this is set, calls to execute() will block and print
        stdin/stdout/stderr.  It also sets the block attribute on the 
        RemoteKernels in the cluster.

        * kernel_client.py: Renamed "worker" and "workers" to "kernel"
        and "kernels" to better reflect the naming of things.
        
        * kernel_magic.py: Made block=False by default for auto-executed
        code.

        * Renamed vectorfunction.py to parallelfunction.py

        * parallelfunction.py, README, kernelclient.py: Renamed all usages
        of VectorFunction to ParallelFunction to better reflect what it does.

        * kernelclient.py: Fixed intermodule imports.
