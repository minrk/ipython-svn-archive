This file describes the steps required to install the ipython kernel.  The
current kernel requires four things:

- The current version of IPython from svn trunk
- Zope Interface
- Twisted
- The ipython1 kernel itself

For a description of the kernel, see the README file in this directory.

For now, the kernel works with the current ipython release or the current 
SVN trunk.

Eventually, the kernel -will be- ipython itself.  But for now you can use
the kernel within the standard IPython.  

= Installation Instructions =

1.  Download and install the current version of ipython

    svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/trunk ipython
    cd ipython
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

2.  Download and install the zope.interface package

    See the Zope 3 interface web site for instuctions.  

    http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface

3.  Download and install the latest SVN version of Twisted

    You can check out the SVN trunk using the subversion command:

    svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk Twisted
    cd Twisted
    python setup.py all build
    sudo python setup.py all install
    
    The extra 'all' in these commands instructs distutils to install all of 
    Twisted.  It may not be needed.
    
4.  Install the kernel from ipython1

    While in the ipython1 source directory issue:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

    After this, the scipts to start the kernel should be installed and you
    should be able to use the kernelclient from within the standard ipython.
    
NOTE:  If you are installing this on Mac OS X, you need to provide the
--install-scripts /usr/local/bin flag to have the scripts put in the correct
location.  Replace /usr/local/bin by the appropriate directory for your system.

An easier way of intalling on Mac OS X is using the bdist_mpkg command of
PyObjC.
