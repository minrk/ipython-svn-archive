Introduction
============

This INSTALL file describes the steps required to install the ipython kernel.  For a description of the kernel, see the README file in this directory.

The current kernel requires four things:

1. A current version of IPython.
2. Zope Interface
3. Twisted
4. The kernel itself

For MPI support, two additional things are needed:

1. An MPi implementation
2. The mpi4py package

Installation Instructions
=========================

IPython
-------

First, download and install the current version of ipython:

http://ipython.scipy.org

Zope Interface
--------------

Next, download and install the zope.interface package:

http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface

Twisted
-------

Download and install the latest version of Twisted:

http://www.twistedmatrix.com
    
IPython Kernel
--------------

The latest prototype of the IPython kernel can be retrieved from the IPython subversion repository with the command.

::

    svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/prototype1 ipython1
    cd ipython1
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

In addition to installing the ipython1 python package, this will also install
a few scripts for starting the kernel into an appropriate location.  To control
where these scripts are installed, you can do the following:

::

    python setup.py install_scripts --install-dir=/some/other/bin
    
MPI Support
-----------

The IPython kernel includes MPI support thgrough the mpi4py module:

http://www.cimec.org.ar/python/mpi4py.html

Follow the build instructions at this location to get mpi4py working.  

Note:

- it is not required to recompile python itself to use mpi4py.
- The MPI support is options and can be added at any time without
  reinstalling the ipython kernel.
