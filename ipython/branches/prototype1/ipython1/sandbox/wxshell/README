This directory contains the classes for Twisted enabled versions of the
wxPython's PyShell and PyCrust applications.  These version use 
Twisted's threadedselectreactor() to interleave the Twisted event loop with
that of wx.  The actual applications can be started with the pipshell and 
pipcrust scripts.

Oh, and "pip" stands for "parallel ipython"
