=========================================
 Doctests for the ``tools.utils`` module
=========================================

The way doctest loads these, the entire document is applied as a single test
rather than multiple individual ones, unfortunately.


Auto-generated tests
====================

%run tst_tools_utils_doctest2.py


Manually generated tests
========================

These are one-off tests written by hand, copied from an interactive prompt.
