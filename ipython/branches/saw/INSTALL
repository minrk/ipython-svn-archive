Introduction
============

This INSTALL file describes the steps required to install the IPython1 kernel
for interactive parallel computing.  For a description of the kernel, see the
README file in this directory.

Please let us know if you have problems installing ipython1 or any of its
dependencies.  Currently we have tested ipython1 extensively with Python 2.4
and 2.5.  It will not work on Python 2.3.

The IPython kernel requires four things:

1. The IPython1 package that contains the kernel
2. A current version of IPython
3. Zope Interface
4. Twisted

If you are comfortable using subversion and installing Python packages, you can
probably just get and install these packages without further instructions If
not, read on.

To get these packages, you will need Subversion (or svn).  Many systems will
already have Subversion installed; if you need more information about
Subversion, see http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Unless otherwise stated, all of the following packages can be installed by
changing to the source directory and issuing the command:

::

	python setup.py install
	
To install into the site-packages directory of your system Python you will need
admin privileges.  If you do not have such privileges, you can use set a --home
flag when you install to select a different directory for your packages:

::

	python setup.py install --home=some-dir-in-your-PYTHONPATH
	
You will then need to set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to this
directory.  More information about installing Python packages can be found in
the Python documentation at http://docs.python.org/.

IPython1
---------

First, you should remove any old version of ipython1 (like chainsaw) from your
site-packages directory.

The latest prototype of the IPython kernel can be retrieved from the IPython
Subversion repository with the command:

::

    svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/saw ipython1

If you want to do development on ipython1 and want to always run the svn version of
ipython1, you should install using the command::

	python setup.py develop

	
IPython
-------

Download and install the current version of IPython:

http://ipython.scipy.org

You can also get the latest development version using Subversion:

::

	svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/trunk ipython

Twisted and Zope Interface
--------------------------

You will need Twisted 2.5.0 and the version of Zope interface that comes
with the Twisted 2.5.0 tarball.  Get these things here::

	http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/2.5/Twisted-2.5.0.tar.bz2

Next remove any old version of Twisted and zope.interface from your
site-packages directory.  Don't forget this!

Next install zope.interface (located in a subdirectory of the Twisted
tarball) and twisted.

Configuration
=============

IPython1 uses configuration files and objects to configure itself.  Information
about the basic configuration objects, their options and default values can be
found in ipython1.config.api and ipython1.config.objects.

Testing
=======

Once you have completed the installation of the IPython1 kernel you can run our
test suite with the command:

::

	trial ipython1
	
The trial command is part of Twisted and allows asynchronous network based
applications to be tested using python's unittest framework.  Please let us
know if the tests do not pass.  The best way to get in touch with us is on the
IPython developer mailing list:

http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev


MPI Support
===========

The IPython kernel includes MPI support.  With MPI support IPython engines can
pass data between each other using MPI.  Our recommendation is to use mpi4py 
for MPI support.  There are many ways to call the actual MPI API:

1. Call into an MPI shared library directly using ctypes.
2. Use one of the many Python/MPI bindings such as mpi4py.
3. Call wrapped C/C++/Fortran code that itself calls MPI.

For any of these options to work, MPI must be initialized by a call to
MPI_Init().  This needs to be done by having the engines import a python module
that calls MPI_Init.  To enable mpi support:

1. Copy the configfiles/mpirc.py into your .ipython directory
2. Set the mpiImportStatement to an appropriate value.  See examples and the
   docstrings in config.objects for more details.

Note: The ipython1.mpi module is no longer supported.
