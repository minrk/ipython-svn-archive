	* helpers/update_web2: helper script to keep our private copy of
	Twisted's web2 in sync with SVN.  We're shipping it privately so
	that our users can use an official Twisted release (>=2.5).  Once
	Twisted releases Web2 into their core distribution and this
	becomes unnecessary, we'll remove our private copy.

	* ipdoctest.py (IPDocTestRunner): major extensions to doctest that
	add real IPython support.

	This covers commits over the last month and a half.  During this
	time the mainline development has moved to the saw branch.  From 
	here out, the saw branch should be used.  However, it should be noted
	that certain things that worked in the chainsaw branch are being
	depreciated in the saw branch:
	
	* All the vanilla protocols are being depreciated.  This is because
	they do not propagate errors properly.  With this said, they should
	still work for most things our interactive RemoteController class
	still uses this protocol.  Until we have a full PB or XML-RPC
	replacement for this client, the vanilla client will remain the
	default in kernel.api.  
	
	* The global setting of a MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE variable for network
	protocols.  Currently, this should be set internally to each specific
	network protocol.  I have created a pbconfig.py file that sets it 
	for any PB users.
	
	The saw branch has significant changes to the way errors are handled:
	
	* Errors are now propagated fully in the PB protocols and we now have
	tests to make sure that errors do propagate properly.
	
	* Our error propagation mechanism insures that the type of the 
	exception in preserved and that *some* reasonable message is given
	to the user.  The message still needs work though.
	
	* Remote exceptions should always raise in the users namespace.
	
	* Exceptions are always agressive.  If one of many actions fail they the
	overall action will fail upon the first failure.
	
	* A failure in a QueuedEngine method will clear the queue of any pending 
	commands.
	
	Design and API changes:
	
	* The controller has been factored into downward (towards the engines) and upward
	(towards the client) interfaces.  This is done to make it easy to adapt the basic
	controller to different interfaces.  Our current one is the multiengine interface.
	
	* The notification API has been completely removed from the controller.  Different
	controller interfaces should add this in as needed.
	
	New Features:
	
	* New blockon modules that makes Deferreds synchronous.
	
	* New PB client that uses blockon.
	
	* Many new tests.
	
	* New testing tools that integrate doctests and unittests and allow IPython code
	to be tested :)

	* ipython1/kernel/controllervanilla.py (RemoteController.execute):
	small optimization to the unpacking, the newlines in the
	stdout/err can be ommitted just by using the 'print x,' syntax
	with a trailing comma.

	* scripts/ipcluster (parse_args): Added a script to more
	conveniently manage clusters.  Still incomplete, but already
	useful for working on a local multiprocessor machine.

	* ipython1/tools/utils.py: New directory for general-purpose tools
	which don't really fit anywhere else.  Similar to genutils in
	trunk, but as a directory so we can organize a bit more as time
	goes by.

    * ipython1/test: Setup a test directory as a sub-module of
    ipython1.  This makes it possible to test ipython1 using Twisted's
    trial command:

    trial ipython1

    This command will find and run the unittests in the test module 
    in files named tests_*.py.  Most importantly, it will manage the 
    Twisted reactor and deferreds.  I have written initial tests for 
    ipython1.core.shell.py.

    * ipython1/kernel: I have begun to write the code for the two process 
    kernel.  I need to write unittests for this stuff.

    * core/shell.py: Began to rework the TrappingInteractiveConsole class
    into something that will become the IPython core.

2006-02-14  Brian Granger <ellisonbg@gmail.com>

    * kernel_client.py: Added a block property to the InteractiveCluster
    class.  When this is set, calls to execute() will block and print
    stdin/stdout/stderr.  It also sets the block attribute on the 
    RemoteKernels in the cluster.

    * kernel_client.py: Renamed "worker" and "workers" to "kernel"
    and "kernels" to better reflect the naming of things.
        
    * kernel_magic.py: Made block=False by default for auto-executed
    code.

2006-02-11  Brian Granger <ellisonbg@gmail.com>

    * Renamed vectorfunction.py to parallelfunction.py

    * parallelfunction.py, README, kernelclient.py: Renamed all usages
    of VectorFunction to ParallelFunction to better reflect what it does.

    * kernelclient.py: Fixed intermodule imports.

    * ChangeLog: Started the ChangeLog for ipython1.
