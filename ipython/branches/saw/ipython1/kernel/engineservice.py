"""A Twisted Service Representation of the IPython core.

The IPython Core exposed to the network is called the Engine.  Its
representation in Twisted in the EngineService.  Interfaces and adapters
are used to abstract out the details of the actual network protocol used.
The EngineService is an Engine that knows nothing about the actual protocol
used.

The EngineService is exposed with various network protocols in modules like:

enginepb.py
enginevanilla.py

As of 12/12/06 the classes in this module have been simplified greatly.  It was 
felt that we had over-engineered things.  To improve the maintainability of the
code we have taken out the ICompleteEngine interface and the completeEngine
method that automatically added methods to engines.

To do:

 * Should push/pull method support multiple objects?
