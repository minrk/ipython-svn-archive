"""
Configuration objects for IPython.

This module contains classes that contain configuration information.  These
classes are subclasses of `base.Config` and define specific attributes that
are needed to configure a particular entity.  

These classes should not be instantiated directly by a user or developer.  
Instead, `api.getConfigObject` should be used to retrieve an instance.  
This ensures that only one config object of each class gets created in 
a given process.

The configuration objects are retrieved by key. A complete list of the classes 
and corresponding keys can be found at the bottom of this file in the 
`configClasses` dictionary.

    The configuration for MPI is somewhat different from all the other
    configuration entities.  This is because the engine has to import
    a module that calls MPI_Init immediately upon starting - even before
    the command line options are parsed.  This means that the mpi setup
    cannot be controlled from the command line.  
    
    To get around this, ipengine does::
    
        config.updateConfigWithFile('mpirc.py')
    
    to get the MPi configuration information.  The mpirc.py file
    will be looked for in:
    
    1.  The cwd
    2.  The ~./ipython directory
    3.  In the IPYTHONDIR directory

    Some common options are:
    
    - ``from mpi4py import MPI as mpi``:  For using mpi4py
    - ``from ipython1 import mpi``:  For using IPython1's basic MPI module.
      This module only calls MPI_Init and then defines mpi.rank and mpi.size.
      This is useful for the many cases you don't need the entire MPI API, 
      just to have a rank and size defined.  You could also probably use
      this approach to make MPI calls from C/C++ code.
      
    Users are free to make their own MPI modules to use in this way.  But
    those modules must to do things:
    
    1.  Call MPI_Init() in an appropriate manner upon being imported.
    2.  Define the size and rank attributes of the module.
    
    It is also a good idea to have MPI_Finalize called automatically when
    the Python interpreter is shut down.  For information about how to do
    this see the `ipython1.mpi` module or ``mpi4py``.
