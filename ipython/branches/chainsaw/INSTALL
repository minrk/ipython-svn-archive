Warning
=======

IPython1 depends heavily on the Twisted framework for all its network support,
and as of Nov. 5 2006, Twisted still does NOT work with Python 2.5 (see [WWW]
http://glyf.livejournal.com/62308.html for details). So for now, if you want
to use IPython1, you must unfortunately work with Python 2.4. We'll update
this information as the situation improves with Twisted.


Introduction
============

This INSTALL file describes the steps required to install the IPython1 kernel
for interactive parallel computing.  For a description of the kernel, see the
README file in this directory.

Please let us know if you have problems installing ipython1 or any of its
dependencies.  Currently we have tested ipython1 extensively with Python 2.4.3, 
but it should work with Python 2.3.x and Python 2.5 as well.  

The IPython kernel requires four things:

1. The IPython1 package that contains the kernel
2. A current version of IPython
3. Zope Interface
4. Twisted

If you are comfortable using subversion and installing Python packages, you can probably just get and install these packages without further instructions  If not, read on.

To get these packages, you will need Subversion (or svn).  Many systems will already have Subversion installed; if you need more information about Subversion, see http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.

There are also a number of optional dependencies that provide additional capabilities.

We also provide a script in this directory called getdependencies.sh that will download (but not install) the dependencies into the parent directory using svn and wget or curl.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Unless otherwise stated, all of the following packages can be installed by changing to the source directory and issuing the command:

::

	python setup.py install
	
To install into the site-packages directory of your system Python you will need admin privileges.  If you do not have such privileges, you can use set a --home flag when you install to select a different directory for your packages:

::

	python setup.py install --home=some-dir-in-your-PYTHONPATH
	
You will then need to set you PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to this directory.
More information about installing Python packages can be found in the Python documentation at http://docs.python.org/.

IPython1
---------

The latest prototype of the IPython kernel can be retrieved from the IPython Subversion repository with the command:

::

    svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/chainsaw ipython1

In addition to installing the ipython1 python package, this will also install a few scripts for starting the controller and engine into an appropriate location.  To control where these scripts are installed, you can do the following:

::

    python setup.py install_scripts --install-dir=/some/other/bin
	
IPython
-------

Download and install the current version of IPython:

http://ipython.scipy.org

You can also get the latest development version using Subversion:

::

	svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/trunk ipython

Zope Interface
--------------

Next, download and install the zope.interface package: http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface.

We recommend the 3.1.0c1 build:

http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface/3.1.0c1/ZopeInterface-3.1.0c1.tgz

Earlier builds won't work, but more recent ones probably will.

Twisted
-------

Get the trunk version of Twisted using Subversion:

::

	svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk Twisted
	
Nevow (Optional)
----------------

Nevow is a web development framework that is based on Twisted.  Nevow is an optional dependency that is only needed if you want to have a nice Ajaxy web interface to the IPython Controller and Engines.  You should get the trunk version of Nevow at the same time you get Twisted as they are developed in parallel:

::

	svn co http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow/ Nevow 

Configuration
=============

IPython1 uses configuration files and objects to configure itself.  Information about the basic configuration objects, their options and default values can be found in ipython1.config.api and ipython1.config.objects.  

Testing
=======

Once you have completed the installation of the IPython1 kernel you can run our test suite with the command:

::

	trial ipython1
	
The trial command is part of Twisted and allows asynchronous network based applications to be tested using python's unittest framework.  Please let us know if the tests do not pass.
The best way to get in touch with us is on the IPython developer mailing list:

http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev

MPI Support
===========

The IPython kernel includes MPI support.  With MPI support IPython engines can pass data between each other using MPI.  There are many ways to call the actual MPI API:

1. Call into an MPI shared library directly using ctypes.
2. Use one of the many Python/MPI bindings such as mpi4py.
3. Call wrapped C/C++/Fortran code that itself calls MPI.

For any of these options to work, MPI must be initialized by a call to
MPI_Init().  This needs to be done by having the engines import a python
module that calls MPI_Init.  To enable mpi support:

1. Copy the configfiles/mpirc.py into your .ipython directory
2. Set the mpiImportStatement to an appropriate value.  See examples and the
   docstrings in config.objects for more details.
3. If you want to use ipython1.mpi for calling MPI_Init, you will need to 
   make sure it is built when you install ipython1. 

By default, the ipython1.kernel.mpi module is not built.  To build it,
give the build command::

	python setup.py build --mpicc=your-mpicc-command

Our current recommendation is to use mpi4py for MPI support.
