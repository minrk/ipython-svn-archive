Overview
========

This file gives an overview of the IPython kernel.  The IPython kernel exposes Python over the network and allows parallel and distributed applications to be developed, debugged, tested, executed and monitored interactively and collaboratively.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file in this directory.

The IPython kernel is a component of a future release of IPython - IPython1.  While IPython1 is not completed the kernel module is fully functional and can be used from the current stable IPython versions.  

The IPython kernel is essentially a network enabled Python instance.  The kernel actually consists of three components:

:IPython Engine: The IPython Engine is a Python instance that takes Python commands over a network connection.  Eventually, the IPython Engine will be an IPython instance, but for now, it is plain Python.  The Engine can also handle incoming and outgoing Python objects send over a network connection.  When multiple Engines are started, parallel and distributed computing becomes possible.  An important feature of the IPython Engines is that they block while user code is being executed.  
:IPython Controller: The IPython Controller provides an interface for working with a set of Engines.  It manages a queue for each Engine and exposes a fully asynchronous interface to each Engine.  Because the Controller listens on a network port for Engines to connect to it, it must be started before any Engines are started.  The Controller also provides a single point of contact for users who wish to utilize the Engines connected to the Controller.
:Controller Clients: Various Controller clients provide a way for users to interact with a Controller, and thus, with a set of Engines.  Our default client is RemoteController Python object that is designed to be used from within Python or IPython.  It be used both interactively and in scripts.  

Getting Started
===============

Starting the Controller
-----------------------

The IPython Controller can be started with the command:

::

	ipcontroller
	
This will start a controller that listens on the default ports for connections from Engines and Clients.  To see command line options for the Controller give the command:

::

	ipcontroller -h

The details of the Controller (which ports are used, etc.) can also be configured using configuration files. 

Starting Engines
----------------

Instances of the IPython Engine can be started with the command:

::

	ipengine
	
Upon starting, the Engine should automatically connect to the Controller and register itself.  As long as the Controller was started with the default ports, the Engines should find the Controller just fine.  Multiple instances of the Engine can be started on a single machine or on multiple machines.  A single Controller can handle up to 256 Engines, but this number is somewhat dependent on OS related limits on the number of file descriptors per process.

Like the Controller, the Engine can be configured using command line options and configuration files.

To run an Engine in the background, you may need to issue the command as:

::

	(ipengine &)
	
For some reason, running 'ipengine &' without the parentheses dones't work on some platforms.

If you have MPI installed, it is also possible to start the Engines using mpiexec:

::

	mpiexec -n 8 ipengine
	
Once the Controller and Engines have been started you ready to use them from a client.
