Please see the doc/ directory for full manuals and other documents. The manual is
prepared using the LyX system (www.lyx.org), but in the doc/manual directory
you'll find HTML and PDF versions.

These manuals normally get installed to $PREFIX/share/doc/ipython-VERSION, unless you
redirect the installer via a --prefix/--home option.  Normally, $PREFIX is
/usr, but your Python may be installed elsewhere.  You can see its value by
running:

python -c "import sys;print sys.prefix"
