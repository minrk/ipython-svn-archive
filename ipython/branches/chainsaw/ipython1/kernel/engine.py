        This method implements the main parts of the kernel engine
        protocol.  It works by analysing the received line and calling
        the appropriate handler method.  The analysis of the line is based on
        two things:
        
            1. The current state of the protocol (INIT, PULLING, etc.)
            2. The command (first word) of the received line 
              (KILL, STATUS, etc.)
            
        The handlers are named according to the following convention:
        
        handle[_state][_command]
        
        The handlers are resolved accoring to the follow precidence:
        
            1.  Handler resolved by both state and command.
            2.  Handler resolved by command only.
            3.  Handler resolved by state only.
            4.  Handler not resolved (default handler called).
