"""A Twisted Service Representation of the IPython Core.

This file contains the ICoreService Interface specification.  Any public 
methods in ipython core must be given here.  If they are not meant to be public
they should not appear here.

The CoreService should not make any assumptions about what network protocols 
will be used to expose it.  The Interfaces and Adapters used for this purpose
can be found in the files corepb.py, corehttp.py, etc.

TODO:

- Use pb.Error subclasses to pass exceptions back to the calling process.
  For this I can put calls to ishell in a try/except clause:
  
    try:
        result = self.ishell.execute(lines)
    except Exception:
        raise pb.Error("execute()")
    else:
        return defer.succeed(self.ishell.execute(lines))  

  The argument of the pr.Error is then available on the other side as
  getErrorMessage().
  
- Security issues.  Turn on TLS an authentication.
