"""This file contains unittests for the corepb.py module.

Things that should be tested:
- The same interface methods that are tested in shell.py and coreservice.pb
- That the Interface is really implemented fully and properly.

It seems like the tests for shell.py, coreservice.py and corepb.py should have
lots of overlap.  This makes it seem like I should have tests that can be run
in different contexts.  Or is this overkill?
