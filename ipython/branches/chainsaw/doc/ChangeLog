        * kernel_client.py: Added a block property to the InteractiveCluster
        class.  When this is set, calls to execute() will block and print
        stdin/stdout/stderr.  It also sets the block attribute on the 
        RemoteKernels in the cluster.

        * kernel_client.py: Renamed "worker" and "workers" to "kernel"
        and "kernels" to better reflect the naming of things.
        
        * kernel_magic.py: Made block=False by default for auto-executed
        code.

        * parallelfunction.py, README, kernelclient.py: Renamed all usages
        of VectorFunction to ParallelFunction to better reflect what it does.

        * kernelclient.py: Fixed intermodule imports.
