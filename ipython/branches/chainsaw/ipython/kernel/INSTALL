This file describes the steps required to install the ipython kernel.  
For now, the kernel works with the current ipython release or the current 
SVN trunk.  It should also work with older version of ipython, but I am not 
sure how far back.

For a description of the kernel, see the README file in this directory.

Eventually, the kernel -will be- ipython itself.  

= Installation Instructions =

1.  Download and install the current version of ipython

2.  Download and install the latest SVN version of Twisted

    You can check out the SVN trunk using the subversion command:

    svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk Twisted
    
    Then cd into the Twisted directory and issue the following at the command
    line:
    
    python setup.py all build
    
    followed by:
    
    python setup.py all install
    
    Run the second of these as an admin user.
    
    The extra 'all' in these commands instructs distutils to install all of 
    Twisted _and_ Zope3 interface (which Twisted needs).
    
3.  Place the kernel related files somewhere in your python path

    The easiest thing to do is simply put them in your current working 
    directory.  Currently there is no setup.py script for the kernel.
