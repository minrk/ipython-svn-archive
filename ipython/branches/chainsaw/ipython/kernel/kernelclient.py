"""The kernel interface.

The kernel interface is a set of classes that provide a high level interface
to a running ipython kernel instance.  Currently these classes use blocking
sockets and thus, do not require Twisted.  

Classes:

RemoteKernel       -- An interface to a single kernel
Interactivecluster -- An interface to a set of kernels
