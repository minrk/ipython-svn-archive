Description: An enhanced interactive Python shell
 IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell.  It can be used as a
 replacement for the standard Python shell, or it can be used as a
 complete working environment for scientific computing (like Matlab or
 Mathematica) when paired with the standard Python scientific and
 numerical tools.  It supports dynamic object introspections, numbered
 input/output prompts, a macro system, session logging, session
 restoring, complete system shell access, verbose and colored
 traceback reports, auto-parentheses, auto-quoting, and is
 embeddedable in other Python programs.
