=======================
Using MPI with IPython1
=======================

The simplest way of getting started with MPI is to install an MPI implementation
(we recommend `Open MPI`_) and `mpi4py`_ and then start the engines using the
``mpirun`` command::

	mpirun -n 4 ipengine --mpi=mpi4py
	
This will automatically import `mpi4py`_ and make sure that `MPI_Init` is called
at the right time. We also have built in support for `PyTrilinos`_, which can be
used (assuming `PyTrilinos`_ is installed) by starting the engines with::

	mpirun -n 4 ipengine --mpi=pytrilinos
