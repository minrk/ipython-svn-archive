==================================
IPython1 Development Guidelines
==================================

Overview
========

IPython1 is the next generation of IPython.  It is named such for two reasons:

- Eventually, IPython1 will become IPython version 1.0.
- This new code base needs to be able to co-exist with the existing IPython until
  it is a full replacement for it.  Thus we needed a different name.  We couldn't
  use ``ipython`` (lowercase) as some files systems are case insensitive.

There are two, no three, main goals of the IPython1 effort:

1. Clean up the existing codebase and write lots of tests.
2. Separate the core functionality of IPython from the terminal to enable IPython
   to be used from within a variety of GUI applications.
3. Implement a system for interactive parallel computing.

While the third goal may seem a bit unrelated to the main focus of IPython, it turns
out that the technologies required for this goal are nearly identical with those
required for goal two. This is the main reason the interactive parallel computing
capabilities are being put into IPython proper. Current the third of these goals is
largely completed.

This document describes IPython1 from the perspective of developers.  


Project Organization
====================

Subpackages
-----------

IPython1 is organized into semi self-contained subpackages.  Each of the subpackages will have its own:

- **Dependencies**.  One of the most important things to keep in mind in
  partitioning code amongst subpackages, is that they should be used to cleanly
  encapsulate dependencies.  
- **Tests**.  Each subpackage shoud have its own ``tests`` subdirectory that
  contains all of the tests for that package.  For information about writing tests
  for IPython1, see the `Testing`_ section of this document.
- **Configuration**.  Each subpackage should have its own ``config`` subdirectory
  that contains the configuration information for the components of the 
  subpackage.  For information about how the IPython1 configuration system
  works, see the `Configuration`_ section of this document.
- **Scripts**.  Each subpackage should have its own ``scripts`` subdirectory that
  contains all of the command line scripts associated with the subpackage.

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------
   
IPython1 will not use `setuptools`_ for installation. Instead, we will use standard
``setup.py`` scripts that use `distutils`_. While there are a number a extremely nice
features that `setuptools`_ has (like namespace packages), the current implementation
of `setuptools`_ has performance problems, particularly on shared file systems. In
particular, when Python packages are installed on NSF file systems, import times
become much too long (up towards 10 seconds). 

Because IPython is being used extensively in the context of high performance
computing, where performance is critical but shared file systems are common, we feel
these performance hits are not acceptable. Thus, until the performance problems
associated with `setuptools`_ are addressed, we will stick with plain `distutils`_. We
are hopeful that these problems will be addressed and that we will eventually begin
using `setuptools`_. Because of this, we are trying to organize IPython1 in a way that
will make the eventual transition to `setuptools`_ as painless as possible.

Because we will be using `distutils`_, there will be no method for automatically installing dependencies.  Instead, we are following the approach of `Matplotlib`_ which can be summarized as follows:

- Distinguish between required and optional dependencies.  However, the required
  dependencies for IPython should be only the Python standard library.
- Upon installation check to see which optional dependencies are present and tell
  the user which parts of IPython need which optional dependencies.

It is absolutely critical that each subpackage of IPython has a clearly specified set
of dependencies and that dependencies are not carelessly inherited from other IPython
subpackages. Furthermore, tests that have certain dependencies should not fail if
those dependencies are not present. Instead they should be skipped and print a
message.

Specific Subpackages
--------------------

``core``
	This is the core functionality of IPython that is independent of the
	terminal, network and GUIs.  Most of the code that is in the current
	IPython trunk will be refactored, cleaned up and moved here.

``kernel``
	The enables the IPython core to be expose to a the network.  This is
	also where all of the parallel computing capabilities are to be found.
	
``tconfig``
	The configuration package used by IPython.

``frontends``
	The various frontends for IPython.  A frontend is the end-user application
	that exposes the capabilities of IPython to the user.  The most basic frontend
	will simply be a terminal based application that looks just like today 's 
	IPython.  Other frontends will likely be more powerful and based on GUI toolkits.

``notebook``
	An application that allows users to work with IPython notebooks.

``tools``
	This is where general utilities go.
	



Version Control
===============

Currently IPython uses `Subversion`_ for its version control system. In the near
future, we will be transitioning to `Mercurial`_, which is a distributed version
control system that provides more flexibility than `Subversion`_.

More details about how we use `Mercurial`_ will be provided here as we make this
transition.

Documentation
=============

Standalone Documentation
------------------------

All standalone documentation should be written in plain text (``.txt``) files using
`reStructuredText`_ for markup and formatting. All such documentation should be placed
in the top level directory ``docs`` of the IPython source tree. Or, when appropriate,
a suitably named subdirectory should be used. The documentation in this location will
serve as the main source for IPython documentation and all existing documentation
should be converted to this format.

In the future, the text files in the ``docs`` directory will be used to generate all
forms of documentation for IPython. This include documentation on the IPython website
as well as *pdf* documentation.

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Docstring Format
----------------

Good docstrings are very important. All new code will use `Epydoc`_ for generating API
docs, so we will follow the `Epydoc`_ conventions. More specifically, we will use
`reStructuredText`_ for markup and formatting, since it is understood by a wide
variety of tools. This means that if in the future we have any reason to change from
`Epydoc`_ to something else, we'll have fewer transition pains.

Details about using `reStructuredText`_ for docstrings can be found `here
<http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-othermarkup.html>`_.

- `Docstring Processing System Framework <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0256.html>`_
- `Docutils Design Specification <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0258.html>`_


Coding Conventions
==================

General
-------

In general, we'll try to follow the standard Python style conventions as described here:

- `Style Guide for Python Code  <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html>`_  


Other comments:

- In a large file, top level classes and functions should be 
  separated by 2-3 lines to make it easier to separate them visually.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Keep the ordering of methods the same in classes that have the same 
  methods.  This is particularly true for classes that implement 
  similar interfaces and for interfaces that are similar.

Naming Conventions
------------------

In terms of naming conventions, we'll follow the guidelines from the `Style Guide for
Python Code`_, which boil down to accepting existing standards where one has been
established by historical use of a third party library (such as WX or lxml, for
example). 

For all new IPython code (and much existing code is being refactored), we'll use:

- All ``lowercase`` module names.

- ``CamelCase`` for class names.

- ``lowerCamelCase`` for methods, functions, variables and attributes.

Implementation-specific *private* methods will use ``_single_underscore_prefix``.
Names with a leading double underscore will *only* be used in special cases, as they
makes subclassing difficult (such names are not easily seen by child classes).

Occasionally some run-in lowercase names are used, but mostly for very short names or
where we are implementing methods very similar to existing ones in a base class (like
``runlines()`` where ``runsource()`` and ``runcode()`` had established precedent).

The old IPython codebase has a big mix of classes and modules prefixed with an
explicit ``IP``. In Python this is mostly unnecessary, redundant and frowned upon, as
namespaces offer cleaner prefixing. The only case where this approach is justified is
for classes which are expected to be imported into external namespaces and a very
generic name (like Shell) is too likely to clash with something else. We'll need to
revisit this issue as we clean up and refactor the code, but in general we should
remove as many unnecessary ``IP``/``ip`` prefixes as possible. However, if a prefix
seems absolutely necessary the more specific ``IPY`` or ``ipy`` are preferred.

Testing
=======

It is extremely important that all code contributed to IPython has tests. Tests should
be written as unittests, doctests or as entities that the `Nose`_ testing package will
find. Regardless of how the tests are written, we will use `Nose`_ for discovering and
running the tests. `Nose`_ will be required to run the IPython test suite, but will
not be required to simply use IPython.

.. _Nose: http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/

Tests of `Twisted`_ using code should be written by subclassing the ``TestCase`` class
that comes with ``twisted.trial.unittest``. When this is done, `Nose`_ will be able to
run the tests and the twisted reactor will be handled correctly.

.. _Twisted: http://www.twistedmatrix.com

Each subpackage in IPython should have its own ``tests`` directory that contains all
of the tests for that subpackage. This allows each subpackage to be self-contained. If
a subpackage has any dependencies beyond the Python standard library, the tests for
that subpackage should be skipped if the dependencies are not found. This is very
important so users don't get tests failing because they don't have dependencies.

We also need to look into use Noses ability to tag tests to allow a more modular
approach of running tests.

Configuration
=============

IPython uses the ``tconfig`` subpackage for configuration purposes. The ``tconfig``
subpackage is based on `ConfigObj`_ and a `Traits`_-like validation model. The
resulting configuration files are `.ini`_ files.

.. _ConfigObj: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
.. _Traits: http://code.enthought.com/traits/
.. _.ini: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html

Each subpackage of IPython should contain a ``config`` subdirectory that contains all
of the configuration information for the subpackage.
