Things To Do
============


Actions:

* Change setup.py to use plain distutils and create a separate setupegg.py script.
  - Figure out how to handle external things like twisted, twisted.web2.
  - Make a .ini file for packages to include/install
* Move all the IPython1 documentation to REST text files.
* Get tconfig in place.
  - traitslite
* Move ipython1 to new coding conventions.
* Make sure that the Controller does not ever unpickle things.
* Refactor the clients to use blockingCallInThread.
* Convert standalone test scripts to using Fernando's new spawning stuff.
* Redo how scatter/gather works.
* Get paging working for PB.
* Refactor the exceptions in xmlrpcutil?
* Finish the properties and dependencies stuff.
* Get functions integrated into our API as pickleable objects.

Someday maybe:

* Merge in Fernando's testing stuff into ipython1.testutils.
* Add capability to spawn engines using mpirun.
* Finish MPI support for the controller<->engine communication.


Questions:

* is it a message, result or command in the new core?
* should the id attribute of engines be called engineID? (there are lots of ids around)
