Things To Do
============

Current:

* Refactor the clients to use blockingCallInThread.
* Finish threaded versions of things.
* Finish MPI support for the controller<->engine communication.
* Convert standalone test scripts to using Fernando's new spawning stuff.
* Merge in Fernando's testing stuff into ipython1.testutils.
* Add capability to spawn engines using mpirun.
* Refactor the exceptions in xmlrpcutil.
* Finish the properties and dependencies stuff.
* Get functions integrated into our API as pickleable objects.

Ongoing:

* is it a message, result or command in the new core?
* should the id attribute of engines be called engineID? (there are lots of ids around)
