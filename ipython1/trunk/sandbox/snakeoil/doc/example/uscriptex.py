"""A standalone script treated as a test.

The script is treated as a single unittest, and if it runs to completion the
test is marked as a pass.  Any unhandled exception is considered an error,
except for an AssertionError.

See the companion uscriptex2.py file for an example of how to do more
fine-grained tests within a script.
