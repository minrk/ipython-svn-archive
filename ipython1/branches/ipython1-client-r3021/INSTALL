Introduction
============

IPython1 enables parallel applications to be developed in Python.  This INSTALL file describes the steps required to install ipython1.  For a description of ipython1, see the README file in this directory.

Please let us know if you have problems installing ipython1 or any of its
dependencies.  Currently we have tested ipython1 extensively with Python 2.4
and 2.5.  It will not work on Python 2.3.

IPython1 kernel requires four things:

1. Setuptools
2. IPython
3. Zope Interface
4. Twisted

It also has the following optional dependencies:

1. pexpect (used for certain tests)
2. httplib2 (used for blocking http clients)
3. sqlalchemy (used for the prototype ipython1 notebook)
4. mpi4py (for MPI support)

If you are comfortable using subversion and installing Python packages, you can probably just get and install these packages without further instructions If not, read on.

To get these packages, you will need Subversion (or svn).  Many systems will
already have Subversion installed; if you need more information about
Subversion, see http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Unless otherwise stated, all of the following packages can be installed by
changing to their source directory and issuing the command:

::

	python setup.py install
	
To install into the site-packages directory of your system Python you will need admin privileges.  More information about installing Python packages can be found in the Python documentation at http://docs.python.org/.

Setuptools
----------

IPython1 uses setuptools for installation.  Currently this is required, but 
eventually, we will likely make this optional.  We recommend using the latest
development of setuptools (svn trunk).

IPython
-------

Download and install the current version of IPython:

http://ipython.scipy.org

You can also get the latest development version using Subversion:

::

	svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/trunk ipython

Twisted and Zope Interface
--------------------------

You will need Twisted 2.5.0 and the version of Zope interface that comes
with the Twisted 2.5.0 tarball.  Get these things here::

	http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/2.5/Twisted-2.5.0.tar.bz2

Next remove any old version of Twisted and zope.interface from your
site-packages directory.  Don't forget this!

Next install zope.interface (located in a subdirectory of the Twisted
tarball) and twisted.

IPython1
---------

First, you should remove any old versions of ipython1 from your site-packages directory.  The latest prototype of the IPython kernel can be retrieved from the IPython Subversion repository with the command:

::

    svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython1/trunk ipython1

If you want to do development on ipython1 and want to always run the svn version of ipython1, you should install using the command::

	python setup.py develop
	
Then each time you do an "svn up" you will not need to reinstall ipython1.

Configuration
=============

IPython1 has a configuration system.  When you run ipython1 for the first
time, the default configuration files are written you your ~/.ipython directory.  The basic config files are ipython1.core.ini, ipython1.kernel.ini and ipython1.notebook.ini.  Command line options override these configuration files.

Testing
=======

Once you have completed the installation of the IPython1 kernel you can run our test suite with the command:

::

	trial ipython1
	
The trial command is part of Twisted and allows asynchronous network based
applications to be tested using python's unittest framework.  Please let us
know if the tests do not pass.  The best way to get in touch with us is on the
IPython developer mailing list:

http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev


MPI Support
===========

IPython1 includes MPI support, which enables the ipython1 engines to
pass data between each other using MPI.  Our recommendation is to use mpi4py 
for MPI support, but ipython1 supports any code (Python or in a compiled language) that uses MPI.  The simplest way of getting started with MPI is to 
install an MPI implementation (we recommend OpenMPI) and mpi4py (mpi4py.scipy.org) and then start the engines using::

	mpirun -n 4 ipengine --mpi=mpi4py
	
This will automatically import mpi4py and make sure that MPI_Init is called
at the right time.  We also have built in support for PyTrilinos, which
can be used (assuming PyTrilinos is installed) by starting the engines with::

	mpirun -n 4 ipengine --mpi=pytrilinos
