"""Classes to manage pending Deferreds.

A pending deferred is a deferred that may or may not have fired.  This module
is useful for taking a class whose methods return deferreds and wrapping it to
provide API that keeps track of those deferreds for later retrieval.  See the
tests for examples of its usage.
