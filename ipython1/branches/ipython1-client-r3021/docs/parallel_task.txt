The TaskClient interface to the controller presents the engines as a fault
tolerant, dynamic load-balancing system.  You can even have a
RemoteController and a TaskClient simultaneously connected to the same
controller.  But, be warned, the tasks will share the namespace on the 
engines with the RemoteController.  But, this is actually a feature that allows
you to do some really nice things.

First create a TaskClient objects::

	>>> import ipython1.kernel.api as kernel
	>>> tc = kernel.TaskClient(('127.0.0.1',10113))
	
Note that the port is different than the RemoteController.  Now you can 
start submitting tasks by passing instances of kernel.Task to tc.run.

It is best to check out the examples of using the task farming stuff in 
ipython1/doc/examples.
