=================================
IPython1's MultiEngine Interface
=================================

The best source of documentation about how to use the controller and engines
is the docstrings of kernel modules.  Eventually, we will provide more 
details in this readme.

The RemoteController client
---------------------------

Once a controller and engines are running you can connect to it using the 
`RemoteController` class.  This class provides a client for the MultiEngine
interface.  Don't worry about what this means for now, it will become
clear as you use it.

First import the ipython1 client and create a RemoteController instance::

	>>> import ipython1.kernel.api as kernel
	>>> rc = kernel.RemoteController(('127.0.0.1',10105))
	
Now you can see what engines are registered with the controller::

	>>> rc.get_ids()
	[0,1,2,3]

If this works, you are ready to go.  Start next by looking at the docstrings
for the following commands:

1. execute
2. push/pull
3. scatter/gather
