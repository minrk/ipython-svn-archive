	* Sheet.py (Sheet.__update_celllist): Fixed a bug where a text
	window would not be created if the list of <para> elements was at
	the end of the document

	* textplugin.py (TextDocumentPlugin.get_xml_text): Fixed escaping
	of the test string.

	* PlainTextPlugin.py (PlainTextCtrl.__init__): Changed the colour
	of the margin to pale red. Windows of this type cannot be created
	by nbshell interface at the moment, however they will be shown if
	a tag in the notebook document is unsupported.

	* textplugin.py: 
	* Main.py (App.RegisterPlugins): Added a text plugin which
	converts plain text to a list of <para> elements in the xml
	code. It is used instead of the old plaintext plugin, which will
	soon be renamed. This resolves ticket #9

	* Sheet.py (Sheet.UpdateDoc):
	* PlainTextPlugin.py (PlainTextDocumentPlugin.get_xml_text):
	* PythonPlugin.py (PythonDocumentPlugin.get_xml_text):
	* FigurePlugin.py (FigureDocumentPlugin.get_xml_text):
	* textplugin.py (TextDocumentPlugin.get_xml_text): Moved the code
	that generates xml from plugin data to the
	plugins. Sheet.UpdateDoc does not depend on the specific plugins
	anymore.

	* Sheet.py (Sheet.__update_celllist): Changed to create instance
	of the new text plugin when encounters a list of <para> elements
	in a sheet
	
	* Sheet.py (Sheet.InsertText): Changed method to create an
	instance ot the new text plugin

	* nbshell/frame.py (ipnFrame.__init__): Moved printing
	initialization to ipnFrame.OnPrint to avoid a strange warning
	message	python gave me

	* nbshell/IPythonLog.py (IPythonLog.__init__):
	* nbshell/Main.py: Moved the code that sets the excepthook to
	Main.py.
	
	* IPython/tzanko/Shell.py (IPShellGUI.runlines): Also fixed
	runlines to restore genutils.Term when done, because FormattedTB
	uses it.

	* nbshell/PythonPlugin.py
	(PythonNotebookViewPlugin.InsertLineBreak): Fixed a bug where an
	additional newline would be added if the current line was empty.

	* nbshell/PythonPlugin.py (PythonNotebookViewPlugin.Copy): Changed
	behaviour. Now a codetext object (text of cells without the
	prompts) is always created and is used when user tries to paste
	within a cell. This mostly fixes ticket #13 but now there is no
	direct way to paste a list of cells after the last cell. I wanted
	to fix this by adding an additional empty line after the last
	cell, but this introduced more problems than it solved. For the
	moment, I'll consider the ticket closed.
		
	* nbshell/utils.py: Added functions delta_time() and reset_timer()
	which can be used for very simple profiling. I use them in Main to
	see how fast nbshell loads.

	* nbshell/Sheet.py:
	* nbshell/ipnDocument.py: Deleted some unnecessary code and
	changed Sheet.Clear() a little, which slightly decreased loading
	time.

	* IPython/tzanko/genutils.py (IOStream.write): Managed to reach
	code which noone has run before in write(), and found and fixed a
	small bug there.

	* README:
	* ez_setup.py:
	* setup.py: Removed ez_setup stuff.

2005-09-10  Tzanko Matev  <tsanko at gmail dot com>

	* nbdoc/notebook.py (Notebook.default_sheet): Changed behaviour so
	it doesn't put the zero cell in the default sheet.

	* nbshell/IPythonLog.py (IPythonLog.__init__): Reverted Fernando's
	changes about the In[0] cell. We need to allow the user to choose
	if they need plotting turned on, and which library to use by
	default, maybe through an additional File->New menu. Also we
	should store the default settings in a configuration file. But the
	actual initialization code must be in the notebook.

	* nbshell/PythonPlugin.py (PythonNotebookViewPlugin.Update):
	Reverted part of Fernando's changes and added a comment why the
	strange code was needed.
	
2005-09-10  Fernando Perez  <Fernando.Perez@colorado.edu>

	* nbshell/plotting_backends/matplotlib_backend.py
	(PlotLibraryInterface.grab_png): Added dpi and number options to
	grab_png and grab_figure.

	* nbshell/PythonPlugin.py (PythonNotebookViewPlugin.Update):
	Removed code which was causing the spurious newline problem.  I
	cut out a whole section which seemed a no-op to me.  Tzanko: please
	double check that I didn't screw up (I'm just starting to learn
	the code).

2005-09-09  Fernando Perez  <Fernando.Perez@colorado.edu>

	* nbshell/PythonPlugin.py (PythonNotebookViewPlugin.__init__): Set
	the in/out prompt templates to an instance variable.  Eventually
	we'll need to support the dynamic ipython prompts, but only once
	they've been abstracted out from their current tangled mess.  At
	least now this gives slightly cleaner code which is consistent
	with previous (default) ipython.

	* nbshell/IPythonLog.py (IPythonLog.__init__): Added a formatted
	traceback printer into sys.excepthook for easier debugging.
	Removed the In[0] cell with the visible mpl hack, now that hack is
	tucked inside.  We'll need to clean this up later, once we support
	ipython profiles (matplotlib should NOT be a dependency, in case
	people want to use this for non-plotting work).

09.07.2005:

	* Fixed a bug in copy/paste according to ticket #13

	* Deleted help message in the beginning (ticket #16)
09.05.2005:

	* Added status bar

	* Fixed a bug in grab_figure which threw an exception when called
	without an active figure

	* Now stdout and stderr are also wrapped as the output. Before
	when one of these were too long, the window displaying the block
	would not change its size properly so scrolling inside a block
	would occur. As a result parts of the text would be hidden.

	* Fixed a bug that the caret would not show automatically when a
	document is created or loaded

	* Fixed a bug in scrolling, the current line would be
	partially hidden if at the bottom at the window

	* Changed genutils.shell in IPython to put the output of a command
	in sys.stdout and sys.stderr
	
08.30.2005:

	* Added copy/pasting. Currently you can only make selections
	inside one block. 

	* Added cutting and deleting parts of a cell and a list of cells
	inside a block
	
08.26.2005:

	* Added advanced reexecution of cells. Use the new NBShell->Rerun
	menu.

08.25.2005
	* Added printing support

	* Added support for exporting notebooks using nbdoc

	* Ctrl-Enter now reruns the current cell and all cells after it
	
08.22.2005
	* Changed NewCell to Cell to match the cleanup in nbdoc --antont

	* Fixed some UI glitches

	* Added a CellCtrlBase class which will be a base class for all
	controlls used for displaying parts of the notebook

	* Added mouse wheel support

	* Added proper support for deleting characters in a Python code
	block using the Delete and Backspace keys
	

08.18.2005:
	* Fixed a bug in DeleteCell

	* Changed nbshell to use the NewCell class in nbdoc
08.17.2005:
	* Added tests for deleting and inserting blocks

	* Fixed some bugs
08.16.2005:
	* Added deletion of cells

	* Added some testing framework and one test

	* Added some methods for testing the notebook format
	
08.13.2005:
	* Changed format of notebook files. Now nbshell supports the
	docbook format.

	* Refactored methods for inserting cells in the notebook and added
	UI to use them

08.10.2005:
	* Added a type variable in each XXXDocumnetPlugin class the
	current types are 'python', 'plaintext' and 'figure'

	* Added a property currentcell in the sheet, whichs points to the
	active cell, and a property position in the python and plaintext
	plugins which returns the current position in the plugin.

	* Fixed a bug where the last input disappears after a save

	* Changed bahaviour. Now the cell with number 0 contains code
	which should not be displayed on the sheet. However the
	default_sheet method in notabene.notebook.Notebook does display
	this cell on the sheet.

	* Added support for the Matplotlib plotting library. Currently a
	function grab_figure(caption=None) is exposed in the user
	namespace which will get the current figure and place it after the
	input cell where grab_figure() was called. Check figuretest.nbk in
	the tests dirrectory. The API for adding other plotting libraries is
	not yet ready.
	
08.07.2005:
	* Added support for insertion of cells. Now when you are in a text
	cell and press Ctrl-I a code cell will be inserted at the place of
	the cursor. When in a code cell, a text cell is inserted

	* Fixed selection in code cells. Now only whole <ipython-cell>
	elements can be selected.

	* Added last inputs. Now for each log there is a cell with empty
	input which is displayed in the sheet.This cell always has the
	largest number in the log. It is added after the nbk file is
	loaded and removed before it is saved. It is used to append code
	to the log.

	* Added support for figures in the sheet.

	* Added directory tests for test notebooks
	
08.01.2005:
	* Changed behaviour to suport multiline inputs. Now when the user
	presses Enter, we simply insert a new line at the place of the
	cursor. Input is executed when the user presses Shift-Enter

	* Added support for editing and execution of arbitrary input
	cells.

07.31.2005:
	* Changed PythonPlugin to support the <ipython-cell type='...'>
	format of elements in <ipython-block>

	* Changed the algorithm by which outputs are displayed after a
	cell is rerun
