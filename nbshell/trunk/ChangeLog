	* Added support for insertion of cells. Now when you are in a text
	cell and press Ctrl-I a code cell will be inserted at the place of
	the cursor. When in a code cell, a text cell is inserted

	* Fixed selection in code cells. Now only whole <ipython-cell>
	elements can be selected.

	input which is displayed in the sheet.This cell always has the
	largest number in the log. It is added after the nbk file is

	cells.
