09.05.2005:

	* Added status bar

	* Fixed a bug in grab_figure which threw an exception when called
	without an active figure

	* Now stdout and stderr are also wrapped as the output. Before
	when one of these were too long, the window displaying the block
	would not change its size properly so scrolling inside a block
	would occur. As a result parts of the text would be hidden.

	* Fixed a bug that the caret would not show automatically when a
	document is created or loaded

	* Fixed a bug in scrolling, the current line would be
	partially hidden if at the bottom at the window

	* Changed genutils.shell in IPython to put the output of a command
	in sys.stdout and sys.stderr
	
08.30.2005:

	* Added copy/pasting. Currently you can only make selections
	inside one block. 

	* Added cutting and deleting parts of a cell and a list of cells
	inside a block
	
08.26.2005:

	* Added advanced reexecution of cells. Use the new NBShell->Rerun
	menu.

08.25.2005
	* Added printing support

	* Added support for exporting notebooks using nbdoc

	* Ctrl-Enter now reruns the current cell and all cells after it
	
08.22.2005
	* Changed NewCell to Cell to match the cleanup in nbdoc --antont

	* Fixed some UI glitches

	* Added a CellCtrlBase class which will be a base class for all
	controlls used for displaying parts of the notebook

	* Added mouse wheel support

	* Added proper support for deleting characters in a Python code
	block using the Delete and Backspace keys
	

08.18.2005:
	* Fixed a bug in DeleteCell

	* Changed nbshell to use the NewCell class in nbdoc
08.17.2005:
	* Added tests for deleting and inserting blocks

	* Fixed some bugs
08.16.2005:
	* Added deletion of cells

	* Added some testing framework and one test

	* Added some methods for testing the notebook format
	
08.13.2005:
	* Changed format of notebook files. Now nbshell supports the
	docbook format.

	* Refactored methods for inserting cells in the notebook and added
	UI to use them

08.10.2005:
	* Added a type variable in each XXXDocumnetPlugin class the
	current types are 'python', 'plaintext' and 'figure'

	* Added a property currentcell in the sheet, whichs points to the
	active cell, and a property position in the python and plaintext
	plugins which returns the current position in the plugin.

	* Fixed a bug where the last input disappears after a save

	* Changed bahaviour. Now the cell with number 0 contains code
	which should not be displayed on the sheet. However the
	default_sheet method in notabene.notebook.Notebook does display
	this cell on the sheet.

	* Added support for the Matplotlib plotting library. Currently a
	function grab_figure(caption=None) is exposed in the user
	namespace which will get the current figure and place it after the
	input cell where grab_figure() was called. Check figuretest.nbk in
	the tests dirrectory. The API for adding other plotting libraries is
	not yet ready.
	
08.07.2005:
	* Added support for insertion of cells. Now when you are in a text
	cell and press Ctrl-I a code cell will be inserted at the place of
	the cursor. When in a code cell, a text cell is inserted

	* Fixed selection in code cells. Now only whole <ipython-cell>
	elements can be selected.

	* Added last inputs. Now for each log there is a cell with empty
	input which is displayed in the sheet.This cell always has the
	largest number in the log. It is added after the nbk file is
	loaded and removed before it is saved. It is used to append code
	to the log.

	* Added support for figures in the sheet.

	* Added directory tests for test notebooks
	
08.01.2005:
	* Changed behaviour to suport multiline inputs. Now when the user
	presses Enter, we simply insert a new line at the place of the
	cursor. Input is executed when the user presses Shift-Enter

	* Added support for editing and execution of arbitrary input
	cells.

07.31.2005:
	* Changed PythonPlugin to support the <ipython-cell type='...'>
	format of elements in <ipython-block>

	* Changed the algorithm by which outputs are displayed after a
	cell is rerun
