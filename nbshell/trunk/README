NBShell - A Notebook Interface for IPython
===========================================

NBShell is a Graphical User Interface for the Interactive Python project. It
will be capable of editing so-called notebook files that will contain
formatted text, Python code and figures. The idea was taken from the
commercial scientific applications Mathematica and Maple


Dependencies
-------------

NBShell requires Python 2.4. In the commands below I will use 'python2.4' as
the name of the Python 2.4 interpreter. If your Python interpreter has a
different name you should replace 'python2.4' with your intepreter's name

 In order to use NBShell you will need to download and install the
following Python packages:


1. WxPython, version >= 2.5.3

2. The latest development version of lxml. The latest stable version 0.7 has
some bugs, so you will need to download it from their Subversion repository,
at

   http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk

lxml needs the Pyrex (0.9.3) to compile. Pyrex can be found at

http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/

If you are using Debian, you can install Pyrex by typing

# apt-get install python2.4-pyrex

If you have Linux with Subversion installed, you will need to run the
following commands to install lxml (provided you have Pyrex):

$ svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk lxml
$ cd lxml
$ su
# python2.4 setup.py install

3. notabene - This is a package used for procesing notebook files. You can get it 
from the following Subversion repository:

   http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/google-rkern/branches/cell,

so the commands for downloading and installing notabene are:

$ svn co    http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/google-rkern/branches/cell notabene
$ cd notabene
$ su
# python2.4 setup.py install

The current version of notabene requires you to install setuptools. For Debian
users the command is:

apt-get install python2.4-setuptools

In the future this requirement will be dropped.

4. IPython. You will need a modified version of IPython which can be downloaded from

   http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/tzanko/
   
The commands for downloading and installing IPython are:

$ svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/tzanko IPython
$ cd IPython
$ su
# python2.4 setup.py install


Installation
------------

Use the following commands to install NBShell

1. Download the source from the SVN repository at:

   http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/nbshell/trunk
   
On Linux you can type

$ svn co http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/nbshell/trunk nbshell

2. Install the package

$ cd nbshell
$ su
# python2.4 setup.py install


Running
-------

You can run NBShell with the following python script

>>> import nbshell
>>> nbshell.start()

or you can run the file start.py which is in the directory where you
downloaded the source like this

python2.4 start.py
