"""
IPython provides a replacement for the interactive Python interpreter with
extra functionality.

Main features:

 * Comprehensive object introspection.

 * Input history, persistent across sessions.

 * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
   references.

 * Readline based name completion.

 * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
   performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.

 * Configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler
   than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).

 * Session logging and reloading.

 * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.

 * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.

 * Easily embeddable in other Python programs.

 * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler. """
