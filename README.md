# IPython subversion archive

Archive of the IPython subversion repository

This is not just the sourcecode for IPython package itself, but the whole IPython subversion repo, including fork projects such as the early `ipython1` and notebook prototypes.

This includes IPython development history from 2003-2008.

Created with git-checkout-svn and git filter-repo to fix authors

I hope to rewrite the history to turn the svn branches and tags into git branches and tags, but haven't found time
