This is an example of how we might eventually use gasnet from python/cython.

The only problem is that gasnet had to be compiled with a small patch to make
this possible.  Here is what I had to do:

Whereever the following appears in the gasnet source code::

	extern char **environ;

change it to (this is just on OS X)::
	
	#include <crt_externs.h>

And in a the local scope (not global) where environ is used, do::

	char **environ = *_NSGetEnviron();
