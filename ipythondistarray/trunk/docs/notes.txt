Redistribution of Data
======================


2. Walk over local indices of local_array
3. Using old_dist compute global_inds
4. Using new_dist compute new_owner, append to array for that owner
5. Everyone now knows where data needs to be sent

Next Steps
----------

	* Begin to work on operator overloading.
	* Begin to work on other simple functions and methods.
	* Write example scripts.
	
Here is an example of how this might worK::

for i in rows:
	for j in cols:
		a.prefetch(i,j)
a.sync()

for p in stuff:
	for q in things:
		b[p,q] = a[p,q]
b.sync()
