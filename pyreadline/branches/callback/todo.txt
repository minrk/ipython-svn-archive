This is the refactor branch of pyreadline.

Goals:
 - Decouple console from readline. In order to simplify future handling of terminals onother platforms than win32
 - Decouple keyboard shortcut logic from lineditor functions
 - Add unittests
 - Improve cut paste logic to be more like other windows apps
 - Make all subfunctionality like console, clipboard etc pluggable to simplify moving to other platforms.
