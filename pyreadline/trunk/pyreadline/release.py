"""
The pyreadline package is a python implementation of GNU readline functionality. 
It is not complete and does not necessarily strive for complete
compatibilty but rather convenience in use on the windows platform. It has been
tested for use with windows 2000 and windows xp.

features:
- Copy and paste using the clipboard
- Smart paste for convenient use with ipython. Converting tab separated data to 
  python list or numpy array. Converting file paths to use / and escaping any 
  spaces using \ .
