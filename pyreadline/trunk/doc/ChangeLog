2006-06-27 Jörgen Stenarson  <jorgen.stenarson -at- bostream.nu>
	* Changes from yesterday were not correct. Resulted in invisible docstrings
	  when using ? in ipython.
	* ANSI sequence Esc[0m in write_color will now result in a white color with no 
	  attributes (same as in cygwin). But the color of input text is controlled
	  set_input_color in config file with default same as dos-color was when
	  launching python. set_prompt_color controls prompt and raw_input text
	  and also defaults to same as dos-color was when launching python.
	  Unfortunately I have not found a way to control color of text that is printed 
	  with a print statement.

	  file renames in reliably. This version contains temporary

	* Added clipboard functionality. ctypes clipboard code 
	  borrowed from example code posted to ctypes-users. See
	  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ctypes-users/1771866
	* Control-Shift-v moved quoted insert from Control-v
	* Control-v straight paste from clipboard
	* Alt-v ipython_paste. Does some preprocessing of data. If 
	  clipboard text is shorter than 300 characters and has no 
	  newlines and tabs, then assume it is a path and change all 
	  \ to / and then add \ before all spaces. This means you can 
	  paste paths and use them in magic command %cd. If text is 
	  multiline it assumes tabseparated data should be list of 
	  list, if all is numeric assume it should be an array.
	* Control-y yank, alias for Control-v.
	* Control-k kill line, move text from cursor to end of line 
	  into clipboard. Should be move to kill buffer but the kill 
	  buffer is not implemented.
	* Added kill line and yank functionality. As well as mark and 
	  copy-region-to-clipboard.
	* Control-m set-mark sets the copy region mark
	* Control-q copies region between mark and cursor to clipboard
	* Changed version in setup.py to 1.13-svn

	  lucida terminal, this is done in the properties dialog of 
	  the terminal.
